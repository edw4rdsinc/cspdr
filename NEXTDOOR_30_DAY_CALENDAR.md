# Car Studios PDR - 30 Day Nextdoor Content Calendar
**December 2025 - January 2026**
**Service Area**: Meridian, Boise, Eagle, Nampa, Star, Kuna

---

## Week 1: Introduction & Awareness

### Day 1 (Mon, Dec 9) - INTRODUCTION
**Type**: Personal Introduction
```
Hey Meridian neighbors! I'm Jason with Car Studios PDR. I do mobile paintless dent repair - meaning I come to your home or work and fix dents without repainting.

Most dents take 1-2 hours and cost way less than a body shop.

Got a door ding that's been bugging you? Send me a photo and I'll give you an honest assessment - no pressure.

📞 (208) 648-2554
```

### Day 2 (Tue, Dec 10) - QUIZ: Can It Be Fixed?
**Type**: Educational/Interactive
```
Wondering if that dent can actually be fixed without repainting?

I put together a quick 2-minute quiz that'll tell you if paintless dent repair will work for your situation:

🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/can-my-dent-be-fixed

90% of dents CAN be repaired with PDR - but paint condition matters most. Take the quiz and find out!
```

### Day 3 (Wed, Dec 11) - SOCIAL PROOF ASK
**Type**: Engagement
```
Quick question for my Treasure Valley neighbors:

Has anyone here ever had paintless dent repair done? What was your experience?

I'm always curious what people's expectations are vs. reality with PDR. Some folks don't even know it exists!
```

### Day 4 (Thu, Dec 12) - PROBLEM/SOLUTION
**Type**: Pain Point
```
Body shops want $800+ for a door ding. And your car for 3-5 days.

I fix most door dings in under an hour, at your location, for a fraction of that price. Your factory paint stays intact.

The holidays are coming - get that dent fixed before family visits!

📞 (208) 648-2554
```

### Day 5 (Fri, Dec 13) - QUIZ: PDR vs Body Shop
**Type**: Educational/Interactive
```
Not sure if you need a body shop or PDR tech?

This quick calculator helps you compare:
✅ Cost difference
✅ Time difference
✅ Which option makes sense for YOUR dent

🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/pdr-vs-body-shop

Spoiler: PDR wins 9 times out of 10 for dents without paint damage.
```

## Week 2: Education & Value

### Day 6 (Mon, Dec 16) - HOW IT WORKS
**Type**: Educational
```
"How does paintless dent repair actually work?"

I get this question a lot. Here's the short version:

Using specialized tools, I access the backside of the panel and carefully massage the metal back to its original shape. No fillers. No repainting. No color matching issues.

The science behind it? Metal has "memory" - it wants to return to its original form. PDR just helps it get there.

Want the deep dive? 🔗 dentadvisor.org/guides/metal-memory-science
```

### Day 7 (Tue, Dec 17) - HAIL DAMAGE
**Type**: Seasonal/Educational
```
Idaho gets serious hail. If you've got hail damage sitting on your car, now's the time to deal with it.

Quick facts:
• Most hail damage is 100% fixable with PDR
• Insurance typically covers it under comprehensive
• I can help with the claims paperwork

Not sure how bad yours is? Take this assessment:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/hail-damage-assessment

Free inspections - I'll give you an honest evaluation.
```

### Day 8 (Wed, Dec 18) - QUESTION/ENGAGEMENT
**Type**: Engagement
```
Parking lot confession time 🙈

Where did your last door ding come from?

A) Grocery store cart
B) Kid opened the door too hard
C) Mystery ding - appeared out of nowhere
D) That ONE parking spot I knew I shouldn't take

No judgment here - I've seen it all!
```

### Day 9 (Thu, Dec 19) - CONVENIENCE ANGLE
**Type**: Value Proposition
```
The best part about mobile PDR?

You don't have to:
❌ Drop your car off
❌ Arrange a ride
❌ Be without your vehicle for days
❌ Take time off work

I come to your driveway, office parking lot, wherever works for you. Most repairs done in 1-2 hours while you go about your day.

📞 (208) 648-2554
```

### Day 10 (Fri, Dec 20) - QUIZ: DIY or Pro?
**Type**: Educational/Interactive
```
Thinking about trying to fix that dent yourself?

Sometimes DIY works. Sometimes it makes things worse (and more expensive to fix properly).

This quick quiz will tell you honestly whether your dent is a DIY candidate or if you should call a pro:

🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/diy-or-pro

I'd rather you save money on an easy fix than pay me to undo a DIY disaster!
```

## Week 3: Trust Building & Specific Use Cases

### Day 11 (Mon, Dec 23) - HOLIDAY MESSAGE
**Type**: Community/Seasonal
```
Merry Christmas week, neighbors! 🎄

Quick reminder: I'm available through the holidays if you need a last-minute dent fix before family arrives.

Got a gift idea? A "dent removal" gift certificate makes a surprisingly great present for the person who's been staring at that ding for months.

Happy holidays from Car Studios PDR!
```

### Day 12 (Thu, Dec 26) - LEASE RETURN
**Type**: Specific Use Case
```
Lease ending soon?

Dealerships charge $300-500+ PER DENT at lease return. I've seen people get hit with $1,500+ in "wear and tear" charges.

Get those dents fixed BEFORE the inspection for a fraction of the cost.

See what you might be facing:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/lease-return-calculator

Don't give the dealership your money - call me first.
📞 (208) 648-2554
```

### Day 13 (Fri, Dec 27) - RESALE VALUE
**Type**: Educational
```
Planning to sell your car in 2025?

That dent you've been ignoring is costing you more than you think. Buyers see dents and immediately knock hundreds (sometimes thousands) off their offer.

PDR typically costs 50-70% less than the value it restores.

See the math for your situation:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/dent-value-impact

Smart investment if you're selling within the next year.
```

### Day 14 (Sat, Dec 28) - WEEKEND POST
**Type**: Availability
```
Weekend availability!

I know weekdays are tough with work schedules. I do Saturday appointments for neighbors who can't break away during the week.

If you've been putting off that dent repair because of timing - let's figure it out.

📞 (208) 648-2554 or DM me here
```

## Week 4: Authority & Expertise

### Day 15 (Mon, Dec 30) - YEAR END
**Type**: Reflection/Trust
```
2025 is almost here!

This past year I've fixed everything from tiny door dings to full hail damage jobs across the Treasure Valley.

Most satisfying part? When someone says "I can't even tell where the dent was."

That's the goal every single time. Your factory paint. Original finish. No evidence.

Here's to a dent-free 2026! 🎉
```

### Day 16 (Thu, Jan 2) - NEW YEAR
**Type**: Seasonal
```
Happy New Year, Treasure Valley! 🎊

New year resolution idea: Stop ignoring that dent.

You look at it every time you walk to your car. It bugs you. Just get it fixed.

January special: Mention this post and get 10% off any repair.

📞 (208) 648-2554
Let's start 2026 with a clean car!
```

### Day 17 (Fri, Jan 3) - FINDING A GOOD TECH
**Type**: Educational/Authority
```
How do you know if a PDR tech is actually good?

Honest truth: The skill gap in this industry is HUGE. Some guys shouldn't be touching your car.

Red flags:
🚩 Wants to drill holes in your panels
🚩 No photos of previous work
🚩 Pressure to decide immediately
🚩 Way cheaper than everyone else

Green flags:
✅ Shows you before/after photos
✅ Explains what they can and can't fix
✅ Has verifiable reviews
✅ Offers a warranty

Full guide: 🔗 dentadvisor.org/guides/finding-qualified-pdr-technician
```

### Day 18 (Mon, Jan 6) - QUIZ: Is Your Tech Qualified?
**Type**: Interactive
```
Already talked to a PDR tech? Not sure if they're legit?

I made a checklist quiz to help you evaluate:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/technician-qualified

Ask the right questions BEFORE they touch your car. A bad PDR job can actually make things worse.

(Yes, I'm confident enough in my work to share this. Ask me anything.)
```

### Day 19 (Tue, Jan 7) - LIMITATIONS HONESTY
**Type**: Trust/Educational
```
Real talk: PDR doesn't fix everything.

I turn down jobs when:
• Paint is cracked or chipped
• Metal is stretched or creased badly
• It's on a plastic bumper
• Previous bad repair work

I'd rather tell you no than do a mediocre job. If PDR won't give you a great result, I'll say so.

Not sure about yours? 🔗 dentadvisor.org/guides/pdr-limitations
```

## Week 5: Social Proof & Specialty

### Day 20 (Wed, Jan 8) - TESTIMONIAL REQUEST
**Type**: Engagement
```
To my past customers in Meridian/Boise area:

If I fixed a dent for you and you were happy with the work, would you mind sharing your experience here?

Trying to help neighbors understand what PDR can do. Real experiences mean more than anything I could say!

Thanks in advance 🙏
```

### Day 21 (Fri, Jan 10) - CLASSIC CARS
**Type**: Specialty/Niche
```
Got a classic car with a ding?

PDR is actually IDEAL for classics because:
• Preserves original paint (huge for value)
• No color matching headaches
• No risk of orange peel or overspray
• Maintains authenticity

That said, older paint needs special consideration.

See if your classic is a good candidate:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/classic-car-compatibility

I love working on classics. There's something special about keeping them original.
```

### Day 22 (Mon, Jan 13) - FLEET/BUSINESS
**Type**: B2B
```
Business owners with company vehicles:

Dented fleet vehicles hurt your brand image. Every customer interaction, that ding is representing your company.

I offer fleet maintenance programs:
• Volume pricing
• I come to YOUR lot
• Minimal vehicle downtime
• Scheduled maintenance

See the ROI for your fleet:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/fleet-roi-calculator

DM me if you want to chat about a fleet program.
```

### Day 23 (Wed, Jan 15) - INSURANCE
**Type**: Educational
```
"Should I file an insurance claim for this dent?"

Depends on:
• Your deductible
• The repair cost
• Whether it's comprehensive or collision

Sometimes yes. Sometimes it'll cost you more in premium increases.

This navigator helps you figure it out:
🔗 carstudiospdr.com/resources/insurance-claim-navigator

If you DO file a claim, I work with all insurance companies and can help with documentation.
```

## Week 6: Wrap Up & Reinforce

### Day 24 (Fri, Jan 17) - WINTER REMINDER
**Type**: Seasonal
```
Winter in Idaho = parking lot chaos.

Icy conditions mean:
• Car doors swinging harder than intended
• Shopping carts with a mind of their own
• Tight parking because everyone avoids the far spots

If you pick up a winter ding, you know who to call.

📞 (208) 648-2554
Mobile service - I'll come to you even when it's cold!
```

### Day 25 (Mon, Jan 20) - PROCESS SIMPLE
**Type**: How It Works
```
Getting a dent fixed is easier than you think:

1️⃣ Send me a photo of the dent
2️⃣ I give you an honest quote (free)
3️⃣ We schedule a time that works for you
4️⃣ I come to your location
5️⃣ Dent gone in 1-2 hours

That's it. No dropping your car off. No rental car. No hassle.

📞 (208) 648-2554
```

### Day 26 (Wed, Jan 22) - FAQ
**Type**: Educational
```
Top questions I get:

Q: Will you be able to see where the dent was?
A: With a good PDR job, no. The goal is invisible repair.

Q: Does it damage my paint?
A: No. That's literally the point - we preserve your factory finish.

Q: How long does it last?
A: Permanent. We're reshaping the metal, not covering it up.

Q: What if you can't fix it?
A: I'll tell you upfront and won't charge you.

More questions? Just ask!
```

Love being part of the Treasure Valley community.

From Nampa to Eagle, Star to Meridian, Kuna to Boise - I've fixed dents all across this valley.

Thanks for the trust, everyone. Keep the referrals coming! 🙏
```

### Day 29 (Wed, Jan 29) - VALUE REMINDER
**Type**: Value Prop
```
Body shop quote got you down?

Before you pay $800+ and lose your car for a week, get a PDR quote.

Same dent. Fraction of the price. Done in hours, not days. Original paint stays.

Free quotes - just send a photo.
